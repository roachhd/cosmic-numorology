<p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">
You have a compatiability of less than 10%.<br>
 This means that you must work more on communication.<br>
Try to be more open and remember to make a relationship<br>
 special , two hearts must beat like one Due to the <br>
 fact that both of you have a tendency towards <br>
 arrogance as well as to being somewhat egocentric,<br>
<br> this is a very difficult relationship, <br>
as far as romance is concerned. At least in  <br>
 this aspect of the chart.It will only work <br>
 if a certain amount of distance is maintained.<br>
 Each of you has to live your own life.Ironically,<br></p>
 <br><p>
 although difficult, this is not a bad combination<br>
 for most other kinds of relationships. Friendships,<br>
 parent-child as well as business relationships,<br>
 often work very well with this combination.<br>
 Precisely because the numbers stand on opposite <br>
 ends of the spectrum. They complement and balance <br>
 each other. Together, they represent a lot of talents<br>
 and useful qualities that ensure a powerful combination <br>
 in most relationships, except in romance.<br></p>
 <br>
<p>
It is in romance that these numbers tend to<br>
 be challenging. engage in a romantic relationship,<br>
 the people on the periphery think it is very funny<br>
 to see them together. Together but yet so different,<br>
 so unique. Neither John nor Mary tends to conform easily <br>
to the rules and expectations of society. And that is one <br>
of the few characteristics you have in common.<br>
 However, you probably dress very differently, <br>
 have very different tastes, and consider different things <br>
 important. Chances are that you are each other's<br>
 polar opposite. And, while we say that opposites attract, <br>
 the trouble is that they also tend to push each other <br>
 away when they get too close. </p><br>
<p>
There are no easy solutions or foolproof guidelines <br>
that work here. If you have been together for a while<br>
 and your love is strong, this love will keep you together.<br>
 If the relationship is fairly recent, your focus should be <br>
 on your heart, your pure and unconditional love for your partner.<br>
 And here is the most important advice to make this relationship<br>
 last: Don't expect to change or influence your partner.</p><br>
