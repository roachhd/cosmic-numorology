<p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">
You have a compatiability of less than 60%. <br>
This aspect of the chart reveals a combination <br>
that can be solid as a rock for a long time only <br>
to crash and burn in the blink of an eye. Stubborn, <br>
highly motivated, a self-starter and an unconventional <br>
individualist, John is also adventurous and not afraid <br>
of trying new, even risky paths. Strongly driven, the <br>
number one doesn't usually give a hoot about other people's <br>
expectations. </p><br>
<p>
So, John does whatever John wants to do and <br>
will fight anyone and anything trying to get in the way. <br>
Mary is no less gifted in the areas of persistence and <br>
ambition. However, the number four stands for everything <br>
that is sturdy, reliable, patient, responsible, conventional,<br>
detail-oriented and "doing things the way they should be done." <br>
 And this is precisely where some possibly dangerous pitfalls <br>
 for this relationship lie. Mary has both feet firmly on the <br>
 ground. Undeterred by the prospect of having to take care <br>
 of things that might be boring and routine, Mary will do <br>
 the job, no matter what. Mary will not step aside just <br>
 because something is difficult or may take a lot of time.</p><br><p>
 The four marches on until the job is done. Period. John, <br>
 on the other hand, does not have that kind of patience.<br>
 When the forces are no longer in John's favor, it's time<br>
 for war. "Confront the challenges head on with a 'damn the <br>
 consequences' attitude" - this is John's dilemma. This can <br>
 be a thriving relationship as long as John doesn't start on <br>
 a path of unknowns and risky, questionable results. However,<br>
 that will unavoidably happen and Mary will at times be seen <br>
 as a stick in the mud, a source of frustration for John. When <br>
 this kind of situation becomes overwhelming, it will almost <br>
 certainly bring this relationship to and end.<br></p>
<p>
On the other hand, as long as John is able to respect Mary's <br>
need for a secure, perhaps even predictable, lifestyle, and<br>
 Mary can understand John's need to try new avenues, take risks, <br>
 occasionally venture out into unknown territories, the relationship can endure.</p><br>
