<p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">
 You have a compatiability of less than 50%. <br>
 The compatibility of these two numbers is about as<br>
 good as it gets. There will never be any danger of <br>
 boredom, complacency, or emptiness in a relationship <br>
 that has heads turning and people whispering. Like wind <br>
 and fire, the personality traits in this combination can<br>
 both create and destroy, but the one and five feed on <br>
 each other and respect each other's powers. They are <br>
 like a blacksmith and his anvil, and when they set out <br>
 side by side to fulfill their goals and dreams, nothing <br>
 can withstand their combined forces. This is a relationship <br>
 of intensity and moments of rarely achieved highs, where the<br>
 promise of ecstatic experiences of love, spiritual bonding and <br>
 shared dreams is very real.</p><br>
<p>
 As with any number combination, dangers also hover over <br>
 their heads. Sometimes, undesired winds blow and forces <br>
 turn - not so much against each other as against their<br>
 shared dreams. When that happens, their mutual influence <br>
 becomes destructive, turning a moderate, healthy need for <br>
 variety, sensual pleasure and adventures into a negative force.</p><br>
<p>
 As with all things in life, reaching up takes effort while sliding <br>
 down is only a matter of letting go. As long as the willingness to <br>
 reach up and the capacity to put forth effort and self-control exists<br>
 for both John and Mary, this can be a wonderful ride. But they should <br>
 both always be on the alert - it is not uncommon for this combination to <br>
 pull each other down. When the partners allow that to happen, they may end <br>
 up involved with drugs, alcohol, sex, food-addictions, laziness, or blaming </p><br>
 <br>
 the world for their misfortunes, and blaming each other as a final result. <br>
 Therefore, living this combination of numbers can be compared to skating on thin ice.<br>
