<p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">
You have a compatiability of less than 70%. <br>
You are both blessed to form one of the best<br>
 combinations - one that is often a source of<br>
 happiness and mutual pleasure for a long, <br>
 long time. The individualism and originality <br>
 of the one combined with the creativity and <br>
 "anything goes" attitude of the three make for<br>
 a wonderful, exciting, and often adventurous <br>
 relationship. Unlike many couples, John and Mary,<br>
 you play together, laugh together, and often have <br>
 truly inspirational and enlightening conversations. </p><br><p>
 Of course, the number one's typical characteristics <br>
 make John the central force in this relationship, <br>
 while Mary contributes to it by bringing the sunshine<br>
 and lightness of heart that help the two of you overcome <br>
 obstacles and challenges more easily than most other couples.<br>
 Think of this relationship as the tree and the butterfly, <br>
 and I am sure I don't have to tell you who is who in this paraphrase.</p><br>
<p>
However, in spite of the unusual number of positive aspects <br>
in this combination, you should be on the alert for some <br>
potential pitfalls. John values responsibility and loyalty,<br>
 being very serious about goals and dreams, especially those<br>
 involving other people's lives. John has an in-born ability <br>
 to put forth effort over a long period of time and won't easily <br>
 let any goal or dream go. On the other hand, Mary is more playful <br>
 and creative, as well as restless. Mary may well change direction <br>
 easily, especially when a particular goal may seem hard to reach.</p> <br>
 Mary gets bored more quickly and may give up on a project before <br>
 it starts bearing fruit, which can be very disturbing to John.<br>
 However, paradoxical as it may seem, it is precisely this <br>
 unlikeness between your personalities that brings balance to <br>
 this relationship.<br>
