<h2  style="text-align:center;" style="background-color:Light Purple;"><font size="5" face="arial" color="black">Compatibility</h2>
<p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">
You have a compatiability of less than 30%. <br>
John and Mary, your compatibility in this aspect of the<br>
 chart is very unpredictable. Some relationships between <br>
 one's and seven's thrive while others don't stand a chance. <br>
 The initial connection in this combination is usually intellectual <br>
 - a level where you can relate and have plenty to share. John's<br>
 brazen attitude towards new and old concepts, a willingness to <br>
 get off the beaten path, and an open and unconventional mind <br>
 make for a great intellectual partnership with Mary. Mary <br>
 realized at an early age that something was "different". <br>
 The seven is an intensely curious number, challenging everything<br>
 others take for granted. It digs and stirs old concepts and </p>
 <br>
 <p>
 shows how what looks straightforward to the rest of us, is, <br>
 in fact, far from simple and far from obvious. Mary knows what<br>
 it is like to stand apart from the crowd. And what is more, never<br>
 to have felt uncomfortable with that. Though a bit lonely at times, <br>
 it is also very gratifying in that it leads to the knowledge that <br>
 there is more to daily life than meets the eye. No number experiences <br>
 the excitement and exhilaration brought forth by moments of true clarity<br>
 and insight as well as the seven.</p><br>
<p>
Therefore, you are two people who happily venture into new, <br>
strange or unknown intellectual and spiritual territories. <br>
Free thinkers - for very different reasons and driven by very <br>
different perspectives - the combination of which makes a nice, spicy recipe.</p><br>
<p>
Matters of the heart, feelings and emotions - that is where you, <br>
John and Mary, may encounter trouble spots. Neither one of you is <br>
eager to expose your inner self. You are private, sensitive and <br>
vulnerable people. You don't carry your heart on your sleeve. <br>
You, John, because you recognize strength and endurance as your<br>
 in-born assets. Mary because you are comfortable keeping distant<br>
 and remaining somewhat separated.</p><br>
<p>
The human qualities needed to help you experience your <br>
relationship on the deepest levels, where it really matters <br>
and where it can grow and prosper, are emotional courage and <br>
the strength to allow yourself to be weak, which, by the way, <br>
is not a contradiction. Emotional courage is the courage to <br>
expose your sensitive, vulnerable side, and this requires faith <br>
in your partner but, more importantly, faith in yourself. Keep <br>
in mind that it is okay to lay yourself open - you have the strength to survive!</p><br>
<p>
Both of you, but particularly Mary, may be tempted to go the other way,<br>
 becoming cynical and untouchable. Watch out! There is no worse place to <br>
 go and the consequences of such a shift are usually visible in a trail of broken relationships.</p><br>
