<p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">
You have a compatiability of less than 20%. <br>
Your respective Life Path numbers make you two strong-willed but at the same <br>
time, somewhat stubborn people. Often, when you are both around, it is like <br>
having two captains on a ship - your conflicting orders can lead to explosive <br>
arguments, which, in turn, may lead to uneasiness, discomfort and even distress.<br>
Therefore, willingness to compromise is very important in your relationship, <br>
otherwise small arguments can be blown out of proportion. <br>
</p><br>
<p>
 Mary has a remarkable talent for managing financial matters.  <br>
Therefore, Mary should be the one controlling the money. You both <br>
have good business instincts, which could result in very successful <br>
shared endeavors. Should you decide to go that way, make sure you keep <br>
each other’s duties and responsibilities carefully separated so as to avoid<br>
any type of personality conflicts. Whatever your decision may be, it is <br>
important that you have faith in each other’s abilities and act independently. <br>
However, since both of you like to do things your own way and neither of you is <br>
good at delegating, you should be aware that this will not be <br>
an easy task to be accomplished.</p> <br>
<p>
Neither one of you accepts anything less than full respect and <br>
an equal playing field. Similarly, neither one of you can be dominated <br>
or would accept being someone’s sidekick.</p> <br>
<p>
However, while Mary understands the material world and needs <br>
to see material results and rewards, John is more attached to<br>
the satisfaction that comes from knowing you did a good job. <br>

Although you may have your differences, it is important that both <br>
of you understand that you have a lot in common as well. The one <br>
and the eight are very compatible numbers and you will find you <br>
have many interests in common - many more than you thought. Another <br>
positive aspect in your relationship is that you love to share your <br>
experiences, and sharing experiences has, most of the times, proved <br>
to be quite enriching. But the fact that you are both more sensitive <br>
behind that strong and independent facade than you let on opens the <br>
door to possible hurtful comments and increases the danger of doing <br>
each other, in the heat of an argument, more damage than either of <br>
you realizes. Therefore, always keep in mind that the keywords to <br>
this relationship are compromise and communication. If you are both <br>
able to compromise and communicate in your day-to-day life, you will<br>
also be able to enjoy a pleasant, rewarding and happy relationship,<br>
taking advantage of the many interests you have in common.<br></p></h3>
