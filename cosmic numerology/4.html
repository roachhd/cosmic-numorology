<p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">
You have a compatiability of less than 40%. <br>
John is fortunate. Mary's six reflects a great c<br>
apacity for love, understanding, sacrifice and <br>
support. The six is, by nature, perhaps the most <br>
harmonious of all numbers.</p><br>
<p>
But John is not the only one who is <br>
fortunate in this relationship. Mary <br>
also has reasons for gratitude. John will protect <br>
and defend Mary through thick and thin. The power <br>
of the one should not be underestimated. And to have <br>
that power and concentrated energy on your side, Mary,<br>
 can be a real blessing. John can make you feel safe <br>
 and secure, since there is nothing wishy-washy about<br>
 John. This is a combination that can last for a long <br>
 time, without ever going through the kind of turbulence<br>
 so many other relationships experience. But, as always, <br>
 there is another side to the coin. </p><br>
<p>
 This aspect of John's chart reveals an inner force<br>
 and a driven energy that doesn't slow down for anything.<br>
 John doesn't put up with weakness and is demanding of others. <br>
 Like a true leader, John needs to see courage and strength <br>
 represented in others. Mary reveals a different nature. At least<br>
 in this aspect of the chart. Mary is compromising, forgiving and <br>
 sometimes sacrificing to a fault. John has to be careful not to see <br>
 this as a weakness, since Mary's ability to defend the weaknesses <br>
 of others is alien to a number one. Likewise, Mary may at times be <br>
 disturbed to recognize a somewhat hard and unforgiving quality in John.<br>
 Mary should not confuse that with a lack of compassion. John is certainly<br>
 capable of offering compassion, especially towards victims of circumstances,<br>
 where fault or laziness, or cowardice is not an issue. Only when John feels<br>
 someone is not pulling his or her weight, can John respond quite harshly.</p><br>
<p>
 The important thing for both John and Mary is to understand that they are<br>
 very different in the way they view human qualities. Their priorities differ.<br>
 That's all. Therefore, if they are able to keep an eye open for their differences <br>
 and value their respective good qualities, they will certainly enjoy a long life together.</p><br>
