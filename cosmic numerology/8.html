<p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">
You have a compatiability of less than 80%. <br>
Yours is a very promising combination, because, <br>
strange as it may seem, you have very little in <br>
common - at least in this aspect of the chart. This <br>
particular core number shows John to be strong and<br>
 driven, competitive and motivated, and, perhaps, a <br>
 bit bullish and overbearing. Mary, on the other hand,<br>
 is by nature more the "power behind the throne", the <br>
 person who understands what goes on on a deeper level.</p><br><p>
 Sensitive, intuitive, insightful and supportive, Mary <br>
 will always allow John room to throw some weight around,<br>
 without loosing sight of what has to be done and how to <br>
 do it. The fact that you don't play a power game has a <br>
 very important role in this relationship. Both of you<br>
 know what you want, know how to make the other understand,<br>
 and, thanks to these abilities, you succeed in complementing <br>
 each other very well.</p><br>
<p>
Mary is the peacemaker, John, the driving, ambitious force.<br>

However, always remember to look at the other compatible <br>
aspects in your number combination so as to keep this in perspective.</p><br>
