<p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">
You have a compatiability of less than 90%. <br>
John and Mary, you two make up a challenging and <br>
rare combination.  Although most couples keep <br>
looking for things they may have in common, in <br>
this particular case, this does not always translate<br>
 into an advantage. Yours is a relationship of extremes,<br>
 with powerful feelings and sometimes almost uncontrollable <br>
 urges by the partners to "confront" each other. </p><br><p>
 Both of you are headstrong, competitive people who will not play second<br>
 fiddle to anyone. You refuse to surrender your leadership <br>
 qualities, even to someone you are attracted to. And two people,<br>
 both with a 1 in this aspect of the chart, don't often provide <br>
 much room for attraction in their lives because, even when meeting <br>
 the first time, their competitive nature will get in the way of a <br>
 simple loving and giving relationship. Instead, they recognize the <br>
 need to be "king of the mountain" in the other persona and, like <br>
 two bulls, will start butting heads to gain the upper hand.</p><br>
<p>
On the other hand, when two people with this kind of driving <br>
forces meet and do get along, the source of this attraction is <br>
powerful enough to overcome their mutual competitive streaks,<br>
 which makes their relationship a promising one.</p><br>
